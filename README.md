# Reduced-Order Autodifferentiable Ensemble Kalman Filters (ROAD-EnKF)

Joint learning of latent reduced-order dynamics and states from noisy observations, by auto-differentiating through an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) using PyTorch. This repo is built upon AD-EnKF (https://github.com/ymchen0/torchEnKF).
